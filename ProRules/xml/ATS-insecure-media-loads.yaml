    message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration allows for
      insecure accessing of media content over HTTP connections. This means that
      images, video, and other media (AVFoundation) data may be accessed via
      HTTP, potentially leaking that data to others on the local network, or to
      other network devices the network traffic traverses (proxies, firewalls,
      load balancers, etc).
