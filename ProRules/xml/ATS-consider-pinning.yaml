    message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration does not
      leverage the in-built public key pinning mechanisms. The application
      should consider leverage ATS public key pinning to ensure that the
      application only communicates to serves with an allow-listed certificate
      (and public key). By default the device will allow connections if the
      default trust store (CA store) posesses the right certificates. The number
      of accepted Certificate Authorities by default is hundreds. Using public
      key pinning vastly reduces the attack surface.
