    message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration allows for
      local networking, which in some iOS versions is blocked by default in ATS.
      Consider whether or not the application requires this in release builds,
      or for development reasons only. This follows the principle of least
      privelege, reducing the attack surface if local networking is not
      required.
