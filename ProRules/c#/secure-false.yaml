    message: Detected a cookie where the `Secure` flag is either missing or
      disabled. The `Secure` cookie flag instructs the browser to forbid sending
      the cookie over an insecure HTTP request. Set the `Secure` flag to `true`
      so the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS. If this wasn't intentional,
      it's recommended to set the Secure flag to true so the cookie will only be
      sent over HTTPS or to use the Cookie Policy Middleware to globally set the
      Secure flag. You can then use the CookieOptions class when instantiating
      the cookie, which inherits these settings and will require future
      developers to have to explicitly override them on a case-by-case basis if
      needed. This approach ensures cookies are secure by default.
