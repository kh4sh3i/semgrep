    message: Detected the use of `$METHOD("$VALUE")` which is considered a weak
      cryptographic algorithm. Where possible, leverage the industry standard
      recommendation which is to use a block cipher such as `AES` with at least
      `128-bit` strength, an example of a secure algorithm is `AES-256-GCM`. If
      your company has its own guidelines, you should follow your company's
      internal best practices.
