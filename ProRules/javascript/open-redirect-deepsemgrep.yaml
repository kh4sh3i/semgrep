    message: The application builds a URL using user-controlled input which can lead
      to an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the URL and
      redirect users to an arbitrary domain. Open redirect vulnerabilities can
      lead to issues such as Cross-site scripting (XSS) or redirecting to a
      malicious domain for activities such as phishing to capture users'
      credentials. To prevent this vulnerability perform strict input validation
      of the domain against an allowlist of approved domains. Notify a user in
      your application that they are leaving the website. Display a domain where
      they are redirected to the user. A user can then either accept or deny the
      redirect to an untrusted site.
